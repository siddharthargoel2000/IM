# Inventory-Management

### Project Description
Fruits and vegetables constitute a significant part of human diet habit for decades.
In modern age with the increased disease variant, people became more curious about the natural and organic nutrition.
This current of thought has brought some problems with it which are mostly related to freshness.
As fruits and vegetables are a good source of food for us they are also good hosts for microorganisms like bacteria and fungi too.
Foods contaminated by microorganisms could cause serious health problems in addition to that, decayed fruits and vegetables create several problems during imports and exports, during their storage for food related companies and markets.
To find a solution to these problems a freshness sensor is developed which works with the principle of measurement of ion concentration change occurred in fruits and vegetables.
Performed tests show that according to ion concentration change we could determine the freshness of fruits and vegetables.
This method doesn¡¯t need any chemical pretreatment and it is not a type of storage method like in literature.
This sensor can be used easily during grocery shopping by consumers, by import and export quality controllers or by any food related factory since it could give an average time of usage and this sensor could prove even frozen foods' freshness.

### Business Model
We are creating an automated model for Inventory management system. For checking the Real Time Stock of The product and Getting automatic ordering of the Items in shortage.
It'll be designed to prevent the wastage of the food items by Creating an optimal Environment For the storage and timely alerts to donate if Inventory gets high on storage or it's expiry date is near.
An optimised data will then be sent for getting an apropriate order requests based on prior data using machine learning algorithms.

### Vision
As a  conclusion, the problem  caused  by the  uncertainty of  freshness  of  fruits  and vegetables can  be overcome  by  this  new  and,
creative  freshness  sensor  without  any  chemical  treatment  which  could damage the nutritional value of samples.
Additionally, this novel device could be considered as an innovative project which could be a solution for  microorganism  caused  respiratory  
diseases  and  allergy  like  diseases  by  detecting  contamination before microorganism colonies become visible with naked eye by measuring ion 
concentration changes occurred  at  samples.  Besides,  it  could  be  an  answer  for  economic  problems  of  import  and  export branch, 
also storage problems of food related companies, markets, and farmers
